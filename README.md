# pythonProject2
we use imoprt math because we have to use sqrt for the next part
first i wrote an ndimensional class and used the * method for that
then i created a 2dvector class and the other one before was the parent for this class
i used match to put add sub mul len matmul truediv repr to create all the parts we wanted
then i printed all of them and 3 of them are still 2d vectors
so i made a function for the 3 and i foud the length of these 3
so if the length was less than two return true 
and else return false
then i used filter to filter the part i wanted (less than 2)
i put the filtered 2dvector in a new listt and it was the result i wanted
